# govatar

Govatar is a silly little program written in Golang that generates a unique avatar, complete with a unique color scheme,
 based on any text string. The main aim was to create a slightly more visually interesting version of Identicons.
  Although govatars do contain all of the originally provided information like Identicons do, it is much harder
   to retrieve. They are only meant for use as account avatars, not as data storage.
